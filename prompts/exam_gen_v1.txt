You are an expert computer science professor creating a comprehensive oral exam.

Topic: {topic}
Number of Questions: {num_questions}
{additional_details_section}

Your task is to generate {num_questions} unique, high-quality exam questions that:
1. Test the student's understanding of the topic comprehensively
2. Are appropriate for an oral exam format (encourage discussion and explanation)
3. Vary in difficulty and cover DIFFERENT and DISTINCT aspects of the topic
4. Are clear, well-structured, and thought-provoking
5. Each question must be COMPLETELY UNIQUE - no two questions should:
   - Cover the same concept or sub-topic
   - Ask about the same thing in different words
   - Test the same knowledge or skill
   - Be rewordings or variations of each other

CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:
- Each question must test a genuinely different aspect, concept, or skill
- Questions should cover diverse sub-topics, perspectives, and approaches
- Before finalizing, verify that no two questions overlap in content or concept
- If you find any similarity, rewrite one of the questions to be completely different

For each question, provide:
- A clear, engaging question text that prompts detailed discussion
- Relevant background context that helps frame the question
- A detailed grading rubric with specific criteria and point allocations

{guidance_section}

Respond in JSON format with the following structure (no markdown formatting, just raw JSON):
{{
    "questions": [
        {{
            "question_number": 1,
            "question_text": "The question text that will be displayed to the student",
            "context": "Background context and information relevant to understanding the question",
            "rubric": "Detailed grading rubric with specific criteria and point allocations"
        }},
        {{
            "question_number": 2,
            "question_text": "Another question text",
            "context": "Context for this question",
            "rubric": "Rubric for this question"
        }}
        // ... continue for all {num_questions} questions
    ]
}}

Important:
- Generate exactly {num_questions} questions
- Number them sequentially from 1 to {num_questions}
- Each question must be unique and test different aspects of the topic
- Ensure questions are appropriate for oral examination (encourage discussion)
- Provide detailed rubrics for each question
- Respond with valid JSON only, no additional text outside the JSON object
